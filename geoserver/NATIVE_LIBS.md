Compiling GDAL/OGR bindings from scratch
===========================================

## GDAL native code compilation

In order to be able to produce the same kind of binaries provided by GeoSolutions for enabling extra format support (via GDAL/OGR native libraries), it might necessary to recompile gdal from scratch. In order to imitate the target server, and to avoid polluting my development environment, it could be easier to work into a vagrant box. I personally have an Ubuntu 13.04, where the target server was a debian 7.

Once the virtual machine has been set up, you have to fetch the latest version of GDAL.


Prepare the source environment as follows:
```
wget http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/1.10.1/gdal-1.10.1.tar.gz
tar xvzf gdal-1.10.1.tar.gz
cd gdal-1.10.1
```

Then fetch the necessary dependencies, it can be done as follows, under debian-based distributions:
```
apt-get build-dep gdal
```
Next, I decided to imitate what was done in term of configuration for the official debian package, so I used the following configure options (to check, you can get the official gdal source package, then study the debian/rules content):

```
--prefix=/usr \
                        --mandir=\$$\{prefix\}/share/man \
                        --includedir=\$$\{prefix\}/include/gdal \
                        --with-threads \
                        --with-grass=no \
                        --with-libtiff=internal \
                        --with-geotiff=internal \
                        --with-jasper \
                        --with-netcdf \
                        --with-xerces \
                        --with-geos \
                        --with-sqlite3 \
                        --with-curl \
                        --with-pg \
                        --with-ogdi \
                        --with-mysql \
                        --with-perl \
                        --with-ruby \
                        --with-python \
                        --with-odbc \
                        --with-dods-root=/usr \
                        --with-static-proj4=yes \
                        --with-spatialite=/usr \
                        --with-cfitsio=no \
                        --with-ecw=no \
                        --with-mrsid=no \
                        --with-poppler=yes \
                        --with-openjpeg=yes \
                        --with-freexl=yes \
                        --with-libkml=yes \
                        --with-armadillo=yes \
                        --with-liblzma=yes \
                        --with-epsilon=/usr;

```

As you can see, the official debian package misses the Java bindings option. Let's launch the ./configure command-line program, adding the `--with-java` option, and a customized prefix to avoid tainting our virtual environment:

```
./configure --prefix=/opt/gdal-georchestra \
                        --mandir=\$$\{prefix\}/share/man \
                        --includedir=\$$\{prefix\}/include/gdal \
                        --with-threads \
                        --with-grass=no \
                        --with-libtiff=internal \
                        --with-geotiff=internal \
                        --with-java \
                        --with-jasper \
                        --with-netcdf \
                        --with-xerces \
                        --with-geos \
                        --with-sqlite3 \
                        --with-curl \
                        --with-pg \
                        --with-ogdi \
                        --with-mysql \
                        --with-perl \
                        --with-ruby \
                        --with-python \
                        --with-odbc \
                        --with-dods-root=/usr \
                        --with-static-proj4=yes \
                        --with-spatialite=/usr \
                        --with-cfitsio=no \
                        --with-ecw=no \
                        --with-mrsid=no \
                        --with-poppler=yes \
                        --with-openjpeg=yes \
                        --with-freexl=yes \
                        --with-libkml=yes \
                        --with-armadillo=yes \
                        --with-liblzma=yes \
                        --with-epsilon=/usr;

```
The generated makefile could not potentially lack of some necessary compilation flags. Make sure that the compilation process (running `make`) does include `-fPIC` flags. This can be done scanning the file GDALmake.opt, around line 65 / 66:

```
CFLAGS          = -g -O2 -DHAVE_SSE_AT_COMPILE_TIME  -Wall -Wdeclaration-after-statement $(USER_DEFS) -fPIC
CXXFLAGS        = -g -O2 -DHAVE_SSE_AT_COMPILE_TIME  -Wall $(USER_DEFS) -fPIC

```

Then, launch the compilation process:

```
make && sudo make install
```

This should produce a /opt/gdal-georchestra/ directory with several subdir (bin,lib,share).

## GDAL Java bindings

The bindings are autogenerated by a software called swig. you will have to enter the `swig/java` subdirectory of GDAL sources:

```
cd swig/java
```

Check the file `java.opt` to ensure that the directory defined for your JDK is correctly defined (I used openjdk-6 to ensure the generated bytecode should be able to run with later versions of Java):

```
JAVA_HOME = /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/
```


Check also that `ant` (a Java build system) is currently installed:

```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk ant
```

Then, launch the compilation:

```
...gdal-1.10.1/swig/java$ make
```

This should generate a gdal.jar, as well as a .lib subdirectory with the underlying native libraries ; I copied them by hand into my previoulsy created `/opt/gdal-georchestra/`:

```
cp gdal.jar .libs/gdal-ogr-bindings.jar
mkdir /opt/gdal-georchestra/java
cp ./libs/* /opt/gdal-georchestra/java/
```

## Tomcat configuration

The webapps requiring GDAL/OGR bindings (GeoServer, but potentially mapfishapp) will be placed under a Tomcat server which will need to be configured in order to resolve our specific version of GDAL. The two key parameters of the JVM that requires configuration are`java.library.path` and `classpath`. I chose to configure my tomcat using a setenv.sh-like script accordingly as follows:

```
export GDAL_DATA="/opt/gdal-georchestra/share/gdal"
export PATH=/opt/gdal-georchestra/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/opt/gdal-georchestra/lib:/opt/gdal-georchestra/java:$LD_LIBRARY_PAT

CATALINA_OPTS="[...]
 -DGDAL_DATA=$GDAL_DATA \
 -Djava.library.path=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH \
  [...]
"

```

## Other manual tweaks

Please note that some of the webapps do already include the `gdal-ogr-bindings.jar` package, under potentially another names. These come from GeoSolution and can be outdated and/or not compatible with our version of GDAL. If you have some files into your `webapps/*/WEB-INF/lib` named `imageio-ext-gdal-bindings-1.9.2.jar` or simply `gdal-x.y.z.jar`, they may be redundant with our jar file and should be excluded for further builds. To put it simply, each duplicated jars will try to load the same native library, and will fail if the library has already been loaded.

The proper way to package and provide GDAL native support would be at a tomcat-level, not webapp-level. We should consider building the geOrchestra webapps without this jar, and install the `gdal-ogr-bindings.jar` (`gdal.jar` in the zip file) into the `lib/` subdirectory of considered tomcats.

## OGR output format

Another feature of GeoServer related to GDAL/OGR is the ability to use specific OGR output format when requesting WFS service. This one is easier to configure properly, because it only needs the JVM to be able to spawn a process, calling the ogr2ogr binary. As soon as it is able to resolve the library dependencies (with the library.path option), the feature should work. Check http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/extensions/ogr.html for more information around this feature.

You can test it using a simple WFS request:

```
curl 'http://my-geoserver/geoserver/my_namespace/wfs?service=WFS&version=1.1.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=my_namespace:my_layer&bbox=205384.03354685445,6709880.876710073,317552.2496828853,6802736.856525299&outputformat=OGR-KML'
```
